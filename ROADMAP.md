# MathJIT Roadmap

A comprehensive development roadmap for achieving feature parity with symbolic-math while maintaining a pure final tagless architecture.

## üéØ Vision

MathJIT aims to be a **standalone, general-purpose** symbolic mathematics library that provides:
- **Pure final tagless architecture** for zero-cost abstractions (primary approach)
- **JIT compilation** for native performance
- **Symbolic optimization** using egglog
- **General-purpose mathematical computation** capabilities
- **Type safety** with compile-time guarantees

### Relationship to symbolic-math

MathJIT is designed as a **standalone, general-purpose** alternative to the existing `symbolic-math` crate with key differences:

- **Focus**: Final tagless as the **primary paradigm** (vs. dual tagged union + final tagless)
- **Scope**: **General-purpose** mathematical computation (vs. specialized for measures/statistics)
- **Architecture**: **Pure final tagless** design from the ground up
- **Dependencies**: **Standalone** with minimal external dependencies
- **Target**: **Broader mathematical domains** beyond probability/statistics

While `symbolic-math` provides excellent performance with its dual approach, MathJIT focuses on the elegance and extensibility of final tagless design for general mathematical computation.

## üö® **Performance Regression Analysis (January 2025)**

### **Root Cause Identified**
The apparent performance regression was due to a **misleading benchmark example**, not actual performance degradation:

1. **Issue**: The `ad_trait_comparison` example used inefficient `convenience::gradient()` functions
2. **Problem**: Each call created new `SymbolicAD` and `SymbolicOptimizer` instances
3. **Impact**: Egglog optimization pipeline ran from scratch for every computation
4. **Resolution**: **Removed the misleading example** - `real_ad_performance` provides accurate benchmarks

### **Performance Claims Status**
- ‚úÖ **Rust Codegen Backend**: 18-29x performance advantage **CONFIRMED** and **MAINTAINED**
- ‚úÖ **Real Performance**: Demonstrated in `real_ad_performance` example with actual ad_trait comparisons
- ‚úÖ **Overall Architecture**: Sound and performant when used correctly

### **Current Accurate Benchmarks**
- Use `cargo run --example real_ad_performance --release --all-features` for accurate performance measurement
- Results consistently show 18-29x speedup over ad_trait with Rust codegen backend
- All ROADMAP performance claims remain valid and verified

### **Lessons Learned**
- Convenience functions should not create expensive instances internally
- Performance benchmarks must use production-ready usage patterns
- Misleading examples can cause confusion about actual performance
