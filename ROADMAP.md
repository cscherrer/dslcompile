- **Scope-Aware CSE**: Common subexpression elimination that respects variable lifetimes
- **Hybrid Variable Management**: `VarRef::User(usize)` + `VarRef::Bound(u32)` system
- **Clean Code Generation**: Produces readable, efficient Rust code
- **Property-Based Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage including robustness testing

#### Technical Architecture

**Core Types:**
```rust
pub enum VarRef {
    User(usize),     // Original variables from VariableRegistry
    Bound(u32),      // ANF temporary variables (unique IDs)
}

pub enum ANFExpr<T> {
    Atom(ANFAtom<T>),                           // Constants & variables
    Let(VarRef, ANFComputation<T>, Box<ANFExpr<T>>),  // let var = comp in body
}

pub struct ANFConverter {
    binding_depth: u32,                         // Current nesting level
    next_binding_id: u32,                       // Unique variable generator
    expr_cache: HashMap<StructuralHash, (u32, VarRef, u32)>,  // CSE cache
}
```

**Key Innovation - Scope-Aware CSE:**
```rust
// Cache entry: (scope_depth, variable, binding_id)
if cached_scope <= self.binding_depth {
    return ANFExpr::Atom(ANFAtom::Variable(cached_var));  // Safe to reuse
} else {
    self.expr_cache.remove(&structural_hash);  // Out of scope, remove
}
```

## Ongoing Work 🚧

## Roadmap: Generic Numeric Types in Symbolic Optimizer

### Motivation
- Enable support for custom numeric types (e.g., rationals, dual numbers, complex numbers, arbitrary precision, etc.)
- Allow symbolic and automatic differentiation over types other than f64
- Facilitate integration with other math libraries and future-proof the codebase

### Technical Goals
- Make ASTRepr, symbolic optimizer, and all relevant passes generic over T: NumericType (or similar trait)
- Ensure all simplification, constant folding, and codegen logic works for generic T, not just f64
- Add trait bounds and/or specialization for transcendental and floating-point-specific rules
- Maintain performance and ergonomics for the common f64 case

### Considerations
- Some optimizations and simplifications are only valid for floating-point types (e.g., NaN, infinity, ln/exp rules)
- Codegen and JIT backends may need to be specialized or limited to f64 for now
- Test coverage must include both f64 and at least one custom numeric type (e.g., Dual<f64> or BigRational)

### Steps
1. Refactor ASTRepr and all symbolic passes to be generic over T
2. Add NumericType trait (if not already present) with required operations
3. Update tests and property-based tests to use both f64 and a custom type
4. Document which features are only available for f64 (e.g., JIT, codegen)
5. (Optional) Add feature flags for advanced numeric types

---

## Testing: Property-based tests for constant propagation
- Add proptests to ensure that constant folding and propagation in both symbolic and ANF passes are correct and robust.
- These tests should generate random expressions and check that all evaluation strategies (direct, ANF, symbolic) agree on results for all constant subexpressions.

## Domain Awareness
- Symbolic simplification should be domain-aware: only apply rewrites like exp(ln(x)) = x when x > 0.
- Property-based tests (proptests) must filter out invalid domains (e.g., negative values for ln, sqrt, etc.) to avoid spurious failures.
- Long-term: consider encoding domain constraints in the symbolic system and/or test harness.
