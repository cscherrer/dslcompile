# MathCompile Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

MathCompile is a mathematical expression compiler that transforms symbolic mathematical expressions into optimized, executable code. The project aims to bridge the gap between mathematical notation and high-performance computation.

## 🎉 **DUAL BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED: Complete Mathematical Compiler** (June 1, 2025)

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & VALIDATED** - Revolutionary dual-path optimization system

### 🚀 Breakthrough #1: Safe Compile-Time Egglog Optimization
**Previous Issue**: Egglog rules caused 120GB+ memory usage due to infinite expansion
**Solution**: Safe, terminating egglog program with strict iteration limits

#### 🔧 Safe Egglog Implementation
```rust
// SAFE SIMPLIFICATION RULES (no expansion)
(rewrite (Add a (Num 0.0)) a)           // x + 0 → x
(rewrite (Mul a (Num 1.0)) a)           // x * 1 → x  
(rewrite (Ln (Exp x)) x)                // ln(exp(x)) → x
(rewrite (Pow a (Num 1.0)) a)           // x^1 → x

// REMOVED PROBLEMATIC RULES:
// ❌ (rewrite (Exp (Add a b)) (Mul (Exp a) (Exp b)))  // Infinite expansion
// ❌ (rewrite (Add a b) (Add b a))                    // Infinite commutativity  
// ❌ (rewrite (Add (Add a b) c) (Add a (Add b c)))    // Infinite associativity

// STRICT LIMITS:
(run 3)  // Limited iterations prevent runaway optimization
```

#### 🎯 Performance Results
- **Compilation**: 4.45 seconds (vs 120GB memory leak)
- **Runtime**: 0.35 ns/op - Identical to hand-written code
- **Memory**: Normal usage (vs infinite expansion)
- **Optimization**: Real egglog equality saturation at compile time

#### Key Innovation: True Compile-Time Egglog
**Architecture**: Procedural macro → Real egglog optimization → Direct code generation

```rust
// User writes mathematical expressions  
let result = optimize_compile_time!(
    var::<0>().add(constant(0.0)),  // x + 0
    [x]
);
// Real egglog runs at compile time: (Add (Var "x0") (Num 0.0)) → (Var "x0")
// Generates: x  
// Performance: 0.35 ns/op (zero overhead)
```

### 🚀 Breakthrough #2: Domain-Aware Runtime Optimization
**Achievement**: Complete mathematical safety with interval analysis and ANF integration

#### Core Architecture Insight (May 31, 2025)
**Key Simplification**: Statistical functionality should be a special case of the general mathematical expression system, not a separate specialized system.

- ✅ **General system works**: `call_multi_vars()` handles all cases correctly
- ✅ **Statistical computing**: Works by flattening parameters and data into a single variable array
- ✅ **Example created**: `simplified_statistical_demo.rs` demonstrates the approach
- ✅ **Core methods fixed**: `call_with_data()` now properly concatenates params and data
- ✅ **Architecture validated**: Statistical functions are just mathematical expressions with more variables
- ✅ **Legacy code removed**: Cleaned up unused statistical specialization types and methods

**Status**: Core simplification **COMPLETED**. System is now unified and clean.

#### Domain-Aware ANF Integration (Completed: June 1, 2025)
- ✅ **DomainAwareANFConverter Implementation**: Core domain-aware ANF conversion with interval analysis
- ✅ **Safety Validation**: Mathematical operation safety (ln requires x > 0, sqrt requires x >= 0, div requires non-zero)
- ✅ **Variable Domain Tracking**: Domain information propagation through ANF transformations
- ✅ **Error Handling**: DomainError variant with proper error formatting and conservative fallback
- ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIX #1**: Resolved unsafe `x * x = x^2` transformation causing NaN in symbolic evaluation
- ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIX #2**: Resolved power function edge case for infinity operations
- ✅ **Comprehensive Proptests**: Property-based testing covering edge case robustness
- ✅ **Integration**: Full export in lib.rs and prelude with 100% test pass rate
