# MathJIT Roadmap

A comprehensive development roadmap for achieving feature parity with symbolic-math while maintaining a pure final tagless architecture.

## üéØ Vision

MathJIT aims to be a **standalone, general-purpose** symbolic mathematics library that provides:
- **Pure final tagless architecture** for zero-cost abstractions (primary approach)
- **JIT compilation** for native performance
- **Symbolic optimization** using egglog
- **General-purpose mathematical computation** capabilities
- **Type safety** with compile-time guarantees

### Relationship to symbolic-math

MathJIT is designed as a **standalone, general-purpose** alternative to the existing `symbolic-math` crate with key differences:

- **Focus**: Final tagless as the **primary paradigm** (vs. dual tagged union + final tagless)
- **Scope**: **General-purpose** mathematical computation (vs. specialized for measures/statistics)
- **Architecture**: **Pure final tagless** design from the ground up
- **Dependencies**: **Standalone** with minimal external dependencies
- **Target**: **Broader mathematical domains** beyond probability/statistics

While `symbolic-math` provides excellent performance with its dual approach, MathJIT focuses on the elegance and extensibility of final tagless design for general mathematical computation.
