# MathCompile Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

MathCompile is a mathematical expression compiler that transforms symbolic mathematical expressions into optimized, executable code. The project aims to bridge the gap between mathematical notation and high-performance computation.

## Core Architecture Insight (May 31, 2025)

**Key Simplification**: Statistical functionality should be a special case of the general mathematical expression system, not a separate specialized system.

- ✅ **General system works**: `call_multi_vars()` handles all cases correctly
- ✅ **Statistical computing**: Works by flattening parameters and data into a single variable array
- ✅ **Example created**: `simplified_statistical_demo.rs` demonstrates the approach
- ✅ **Core methods fixed**: `call_with_data()` now properly concatenates params and data
- ✅ **Architecture validated**: Statistical functions are just mathematical expressions with more variables
- ✅ **Legacy code removed**: Cleaned up unused statistical specialization types and methods

**Status**: Core simplification **COMPLETED**. System is now unified and clean.

- ✅ **MIGRATION COMPLETE**: Successfully migrated all code from unsafe `EgglogOptimizer` to domain-aware `NativeEgglogOptimizer` (May 31, 2025)
  - Updated examples: `rule_loader_demo.rs`, `egglog_optimization_demo.rs`
  - Updated tests: `test_native_egglog_integration_with_normalization`
  - Deprecated old `egglog_integration` module in favor of `native_egglog`

  - All tests passing including critical `test_all_strategies_consistency` proptest
- ✅ **DEAD CODE REMOVAL**: Completely removed outdated `egglog_integration.rs` file (May 31, 2025)
  - Deleted 1,102 lines of superseded code containing unsafe mathematical transformations
  - Cleaned up module declarations and imports
  - Verified all functionality preserved with domain-safe `native_egglog.rs` implementation
  - All tests continue to pass, confirming complete migration success

**Key Achievement**: Discovered that egglog itself provides native abstract interpretation capabilities, making manual integration unnecessary and opening up powerful optimization possibilities following the Herbie paper approach.

**Critical Bug Fix (May 31, 2025)**: 
- **Issue**: The symbolic optimizer contained an unsafe algebraic rule `sqrt(x^2) = x` that is mathematically incorrect for negative values (should be `sqrt(x^2) = |x|`)
- **Impact**: This caused evaluation inconsistencies between Direct and Symbolic strategies, with expressions like `sqrt((-48.177)^2)` returning `-48.177` instead of `48.177`
- **Root Cause**: The rule was in `apply_enhanced_algebraic_rules()` in `symbolic.rs` without domain safety checks
- **Solution**: Removed the unsafe rules and commented them with explanations. The domain-aware egglog optimizer will eventually provide safe versions with proper preconditions
- **Verification**: All tests now pass, including the critical `test_all_strategies_consistency` proptest that caught this issue
- **Status**: Mathematical correctness **RESTORED** ✅

## 🎯 **Next Priority: Advanced Domain-Aware Optimization**

Based on our successful native egglog integration and research into egglog's capabilities, the next step is to implement advanced domain-aware optimization using egglog's native abstract interpretation features.

### Key Discovery: egglog's Native Capabilities
- **Lattice-based Analysis**: egglog supports lattice semantics natively
- **Multiple Interacting Analyses**: Unlike egg (single analysis), egglog supports composable analyses  
- **Interval Analysis**: Proven in Herbie case study with domain-aware rules
- **Conditional Rules**: Rules can be gated on analysis results (e.g., `ln(a/b)` only if `a,b > 0`)

### Concrete Implementation Plan
Following the [Herbie/egglog paper](https://effect.systems/doc/egraphs-2023-egglog/paper.pdf):

1. **Interval Domain Implementation** (Week 1)
   - Add `Interval` datatype with proper merge functions
   - Implement interval arithmetic rules for basic operations
   - Add domain predicates (`ival-positive`, `ival-nonzero`)

2. **Domain-Aware Rules** (Week 2)  
   - Convert transcendental rules to use interval guards
   - Implement `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` with domain safety
   - Add `exp(ln(x)) = x` with positivity checks

3. **Advanced Analysis** (Week 3)
   - Multiple lattice analyses (intervals + not-equals)
   - Compositional analysis propagation
   - Cost-based extraction with domain information

4. **Integration & Testing** (Week 4)
   - Replace manual domain checks with native egglog analysis
   - Comprehensive test suite with domain edge cases
   - Performance benchmarking vs current approach

**Expected Outcome**: Domain-safe symbolic optimization that automatically prevents mathematical errors like the `ln(a/b)` issue we manually fixed, while enabling more aggressive optimizations when domain safety can be proven.

## 🎯 **Current Priority: ANF Integration Completion**

With domain-aware optimization completed, the next logical step is to complete the ANF (A-Normal Form) integration that's currently disabled with TODOs in the codebase.

### Why ANF Integration is the Next Priority

The codebase has a complete ANF implementation in `src/anf/` but it's not fully integrated with the optimization pipeline. Completing this integration will:

1. **Enable Full Optimization Pipeline**: `AST → Normalize → ANF+CSE → Domain-Aware egglog → Extract → Denormalize`
2. **Improve Performance**: Common subexpression elimination reduces redundant computations
3. **Maintain Domain Safety**: Ensure CSE respects domain constraints from interval analysis
4. **Complete the Architecture**: Fulfill the original vision of a complete mathematical compiler

### Current State Analysis

- ✅ **ANF Implementation**: Complete A-Normal Form transformation exists
- ✅ **Domain-Aware Optimization**: Fully implemented with interval analysis
- ✅ **Normalization Pipeline**: Canonical form transformations working
- ❌ **Integration**: ANF is not connected to the main optimization pipeline
- ❌ **Domain-Aware CSE**: Common subexpression elimination doesn't use domain information

### Implementation Plan (4 weeks)

**Week 1: Enable ANF Pipeline Integration**
- Resolve TODO markers in the codebase that disable ANF integration
- Connect ANF transformation to the main optimization pipeline
- Ensure ANF works with normalized expressions

**Week 2: Domain-Aware ANF**

**Week 3: Safe Common Subexpression Elimination**
- Enhance CSE to use domain analysis for safety checks
- Prevent CSE of expressions with different domain constraints
- Add domain-aware cost models for CSE decisions

**Week 4: Testing and Optimization**
- Comprehensive testing of the full pipeline
- Performance benchmarking vs current approach
- Documentation and examples of the complete system

  - **Solution**: Made transformation domain-aware, only applying for provably non-negative values
  - **Impact**: Fixed mathematical correctness while preserving optimization benefits
- ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIX #2**: Resolved power function edge case for infinity operations (June 1, 2025)

  - **Impact**: Fixed evaluation consistency between Direct and ANF strategies for infinity edge cases
  - **Testing**: Comprehensive proptest validation ensuring all evaluation strategies agree
- ✅ **Comprehensive Proptests**: Property-based testing covering:
  - Consistency between domain-aware and basic ANF for safe expressions
  - Rejection of unsafe operations (ln(negative), sqrt(negative), division by zero)
  - Interval propagation through ANF variables
  - Performance characteristics vs basic ANF
  - Domain constraint validation
  - Caching effectiveness
