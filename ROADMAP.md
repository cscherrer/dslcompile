  - Fixed all compilation errors across examples, benchmarks, and tests
  - Updated method calls: `call_single(value)` → `call(&[value])`
  - Updated imports: `JITCompiler` → `CraneliftCompiler`, `JITFunction` → `CompiledFunction`
  - **Enhanced VariableRegistry**: Added smart helper methods to automatically configure registries for expressions
    - `VariableRegistry::for_expression(&expr)` - analyzes expression and creates registry with correct variable count
    - `VariableRegistry::for_max_index(max)` - creates registry for variables 0..max
    - `VariableRegistry::with_capacity(n)` - creates registry with n variables
  - Fixed "Variable index 0 not found" errors by ensuring registries match expression variable usage
  - All tests now pass, compilation successful across all targets and features

#### Latest Enhancement (June 3, 2025)
- **Expression Visualization & Optimization Strategy Analysis**: Comprehensive enhancement of the Bayesian linear regression example to include:

#### Summation System Migration (June 3, 2025 11:45 AM PDT)
- **Migration Completed**: Successfully migrated from legacy string-based summation system to type-safe closure-based system
  - **Primary System**: New `summation.rs` is now the main summation API with closure-based variable scoping
  - **Type Safety**: Eliminated variable name conflicts through closure-based `|i| expression` API
  - **Bug Fixes Preserved**: Recent critical fixes (cubic power series, zero power edge cases) maintained in primary system
  - **Clean Naming**: Dropped v2 suffix - `summation.rs` is now the clean, primary API
  - **Legacy Removed**: Old string-based summation system has been fully replaced
  - **Advanced Features**: Migration notes documented in summation.rs for features to be added:
    - Multi-dimensional summations, convergence analysis, telescoping detection
  - **Breaking Changes**: None - all examples and tests updated to new API
  - **Performance**: Maintained mathematical correctness with improved type safety

#### Power Series Summation Bug Fix (June 3, 2025 10:37 AM PDT)
- **Critical Mathematical Bug Resolved**: Fixed incorrect closed-form computation for cubic power series in arbitrary ranges
  - **Root Cause Identified**: The cubic power sum formula `Σ(i³) = [Σ(i)]²` was only valid for summations starting from 1, not arbitrary ranges
  - **Mathematical Issue**: For range [2,2], expected `2³ = 8` but computed `[Σ(i=2 to 2) i]² = 2² = 4` (incorrect)
  - **Failing Test Case**: Property test `prop_power_series` with input `exponent = 2.529031948409124` (rounds to 3.0), `start = 2, size = 1`
  - **Pattern Recognition Working**: System correctly identified `Power { exponent: 3.0 }` pattern, but closed-form computation was wrong
  - **Solution Implemented**: Replaced identity-based formula with general mathematical formula for arbitrary ranges:
    - Removed: `let sum_of_i = n * (start + end) / 2.0; Ok(Some(ASTRepr::Constant(sum_of_i * sum_of_i)))` (incorrect)
    - Added: Direct computation using `Σ(i=a to b) i³ = [b²(b+1)² - (a-1)²a²]/4` (mathematically correct for all ranges)
  - **Test Verification**: All 11 property tests now pass including the previously failing `prop_power_series`
  - **Preserved Functionality**: Other power formulas (linear, quadratic) remain intact and continue working correctly
  - **Mathematical Correctness**: Summation optimization now handles arbitrary ranges correctly for all power patterns
  - **Implementation**: Modified `compute_closed_form()` method in `dslcompile/src/symbolic/summation_v2.rs`
  - **Debug Process**: Created isolated test cases to identify the specific mathematical error in closed-form computation
  - **Pattern Coverage**: Fix applies to all cubic power summations regardless of range start/end positions

#### Zero Power Negative Exponent Bug Fix (June 3, 2025 10:26 AM PDT)
- **Critical Mathematical Bug Resolved**: Fixed incorrect simplification of `0^(-0.1)` to `0` instead of preserving `inf` result
  - **Root Cause Identified**: Overly broad egglog rule `(rewrite (Pow (Num 0.0) a) (Num 0.0))` in `native_egglog.rs` line 107
  - **Mathematical Issue**: Rule incorrectly simplified `0^a` to `0` for **any** exponent `a`, violating mathematical conventions:
    - `0^a = 0` only when `a > 0` (correct)
    - `0^a = +∞` when `a < 0` (was incorrectly simplified to 0)
    - `0^0 = 1` by IEEE 754 convention (was incorrectly simplified to 0)
  - **Solution Implemented**: Replaced overly broad rule with mathematically correct specific rules:
    - Removed: `(rewrite (Pow (Num 0.0) a) (Num 0.0))` (incorrect)
    - Added: `(rewrite (Pow (Num 0.0) (Num 0.0)) (Num 1.0))` (IEEE 754 compliant)
    - Left negative exponent cases unoptimized to preserve infinity during runtime evaluation
  - **Test Verification**: `test_zero_power_negative_exponent_bug` now passes, correctly preserving `inf` for `0^(-0.1)`
  - **Downstream Effects**: Other power optimizations remain intact, no performance impact on valid optimizations
  - **Mathematical Correctness**: Symbolic optimization now preserves IEEE 754 floating-point semantics for edge cases
  - **Implementation**: Modified `dslcompile/src/symbolic/native_egglog.rs` with precise, mathematically sound power rules
  - **Testing**: All existing tests continue to pass, demonstrating fix doesn't break other functionality

### Expression Visualization
- **Indented Pretty Printer**: Added `pretty_ast_indented()` function for structured expression display with proper newlines and indentation
- **Meaningful Variable Names**: Integration with `VariableRegistry` to show expressions with semantic names (β₀, β₁, σ²) instead of `var_0`, `var_1`, `var_2`
- **Smart Truncation**: Intelligent truncation for very long expressions showing beginning, middle marker, and end with character counts
- **Before/After Comparison**: Clear visualization showing expression changes through optimization pipeline

### Optimization Strategy Analysis
- **Multi-Strategy Comparison**: Comprehensive analysis of three optimization approaches:
  1. **Egglog Canonical Normalization**: 35 → 43 ops (+22.9%) - Makes expressions worse
  2. **Hand-coded Optimizations**: 35 → 35 ops (0.0%) - Maintains current form
  3. **ANF + CSE**: 35 → 33 let bindings + 1 expr (-2.9%) - Best reduction

### Key Technical Findings
- **Egglog Issue Identified**: Default egglog rules prioritize canonical normalization over simplification:
  - Converts `- (5000000 * ln(var_2))` to `+ (-(5000000 * ln(var_2)))` (canonical form)
  - Converts divisions to `var_2^-1` form (canonical form)
  - These transformations increase operation count for mathematical correctness but worsen performance
- **ANF/CSE Superior**: Administrative Normal Form with Common Subexpression Elimination provides best optimization (2.9% reduction)
- **Timing Analysis**: Egglog optimization takes ~2.5 seconds vs ANF/CSE at ~0.1ms (25,000x faster)

### Implementation Details
- **Error Resolution**: Fixed `VariableRegistry` API usage and missing method implementations
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added detailed operation count tracking and percentage calculations
- **Performance Optimization**: Disabled problematic egglog expansion rules while maintaining beneficial hand-coded optimizations
- **Better Architecture**: Separated compile-time optimization demonstration from runtime optimization pipeline

### Performance Characteristics
- **5-6x Runtime Speedup**: Compiled code vs DirectEval (unchanged)
- **Efficient Sufficient Statistics**: Automatic discovery maintains O(1) complexity
- **Minimal Optimization Overhead**: Hand-coded optimizations complete in <0.1ms
- **Predictable Performance**: ANF/CSE provides consistent small improvements without pathological cases

This enhancement provides essential debugging tools for optimization pipeline development and establishes ANF+CSE as the preferred optimization strategy over egglog for expression simplification tasks.

#### Egglog Memory Explosion Fix (June 3, 2025)
- **Critical Memory Issue Resolved**: Fixed 22GB memory consumption and forced process termination in egglog optimization
  - **Root Cause Identified**: Bidirectional associativity rules `(rewrite (Add (Add a b) c) (Add a (Add b c)))` combined with commutativity created exponential e-graph growth
  - **Research-Based Solution**: Applied findings from Philip Zucker's research on egglog memory management:
    - Removed explosive associativity rules that cause structural explosion
    - Kept safe commutativity rules that only swap arguments: `(rewrite (Add a b) (Add b a))`  
    - Reduced iteration count from 8 to 3 iterations to prevent runaway execution
    - Focused on canonical forms without creating bidirectional cycles
  - **Safe Rule Categories Implemented**:
    - ✅ **Safe Commutativity**: Argument swapping without structural changes

    - 🚫 **Removed Associativity**: Eliminated explosive `(Add (Add a b) c) ↔ (Add a (Add b c))` cycles
  - **External Fixpoint Control**: Conservative iteration limits prevent pathological cases
  - **Performance Recovery**: Egglog optimization now completes in milliseconds vs previous 22GB memory explosion
  - **Test Reliability**: All egglog tests pass consistently without memory issues

  - **Documentation**: Added technical explanation linking to academic research sources

- **Safe Transcendental Function Implementation**: Replaced unsafe extern declarations with safe Rust std library wrappers
  - **Eliminated unsafe code**: Removed `unsafe extern "C"` declarations for libm functions
  - **Safe wrapper functions**: Implemented `extern "C"` wrappers using Rust's std library (`x.sin()`, `x.cos()`, etc.)
  - **Improved portability**: No longer depends on libm being available or linked correctly
  - **Removed libc dependency**: Eliminated unnecessary `libc = "0.2.172"` dependency
  - **Maintained performance**: Zero-overhead wrappers with identical performance characteristics
  - **Enhanced reliability**: Eliminates potential runtime failures from missing or incompatible libm symbols
  - **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works consistently across all platforms supported by Rust std library
  - **Fixed error handling**: Properly handle Result from `finalize_definitions()` to avoid ignoring compilation errors

#### Safe Egglog Implementation
```rust
// SAFE SIMPLIFICATION RULES (no expansion)
(rewrite (Add a (Num 0.0)) a)           // x + 0 → x
(rewrite (Mul a (Num 1.0)) a)           // x * 1 → x  
(rewrite (Ln (Exp x)) x)                // ln(exp(x)) → x
(rewrite (Pow a (Num 1.0)) a)           // x^1 → x

// STRICT LIMITS:
(run 3)  // Limited iterations prevent runaway optimization
```

### .egg File Improvements Based on Egglog Research (January 2025)

Based on analysis of the [egglog test repository](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog/tree/main/tests) and research from [Philip Zucker's egglog examples](https://www.philipzucker.com/egglog-3/), we've identified several key areas for improvement in our rule organization and coverage:

#### Key Research Findings from Egglog Community

1. **Test Organization Patterns** from egglog repository:
   - **Modular Rule Files**: Separate files for different mathematical domains (arithmetic, trigonometric, transcendental)
   - **Cost-Based Extraction**: Using cost models to guide optimization towards more efficient expressions
   - **Multi-Pattern Rules**: Complex pattern matching for advanced algebraic simplifications
   - **Lattice Integration**: Rules that work with domain information and safety constraints

2. **Mathematical Rule Categories** from egglog examples:
   - **Canonical Forms**: Standardizing expressions (x - y → x + (-y))
   - **Trigonometric Identities**: Full coverage of trig identities including angle addition formulas
   - **Transcendental Simplification**: Logarithm and exponential interaction rules
   - **Power Law Optimization**: Advanced exponentiation simplification
   - **Function Composition**: Rules for composite function simplification

3. **Performance Patterns** from research:
   - **Safe Rule Sets**: Avoiding explosive associativity rules that cause memory issues
   - **Termination Control**: Conservative iteration limits (3-5 iterations)
   - **Incremental Rules**: Rules that only simplify, never expand expressions

#### Planned Improvements
