# DSLCompile Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

DSLCompile is a mathematical expression compiler that transforms symbolic mathematical expressions into executable code. The project provides tools for mathematical computation with symbolic optimization.

## Current Status (June 2025)

### Implemented Features
- **Compile-Time Egglog Optimization**: Procedural macro system with safe termination rules
- **Domain-Aware Runtime Optimization**: ANF integration with interval analysis and mathematical safety
- **Final Tagless Expression System**: Type-safe expression building with multiple interpreters
- **Multiple Compilation Backends**: Rust hot-loading and optional Cranelift JIT
- **Index-Only Variable System**: High-performance variable tracking with zero-cost execution

#### Recent Completion (June 2, 2025)
- **API Migration & VariableRegistry Fixes**: Completed systematic migration from deprecated JIT API to new Cranelift backend
  - Fixed all compilation errors across examples, benchmarks, and tests
  - Updated method calls: `call_single(value)` → `call(&[value])`
  - Updated imports: `JITCompiler` → `CraneliftCompiler`, `JITFunction` → `CompiledFunction`
  - **Enhanced VariableRegistry**: Added smart helper methods to automatically configure registries for expressions
    - `VariableRegistry::for_expression(&expr)` - analyzes expression and creates registry with correct variable count
    - `VariableRegistry::for_max_index(max)` - creates registry for variables 0..max
    - `VariableRegistry::with_capacity(n)` - creates registry with n variables
  - Fixed "Variable index 0 not found" errors by ensuring registries match expression variable usage
  - All tests now pass, compilation successful across all targets and features

- **Safe Transcendental Function Implementation**: Replaced unsafe extern declarations with safe Rust std library wrappers
  - **Eliminated unsafe code**: Removed `unsafe extern "C"` declarations for libm functions
  - **Safe wrapper functions**: Implemented `extern "C"` wrappers using Rust's std library (`x.sin()`, `x.cos()`, etc.)
  - **Improved portability**: No longer depends on libm being available or linked correctly
  - **Removed libc dependency**: Eliminated unnecessary `libc = "0.2.172"` dependency
  - **Maintained performance**: Zero-overhead wrappers with identical performance characteristics
  - **Enhanced reliability**: Eliminates potential runtime failures from missing or incompatible libm symbols
  - **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works consistently across all platforms supported by Rust std library

#### Safe Egglog Implementation
```rust
// SAFE SIMPLIFICATION RULES (no expansion)
(rewrite (Add a (Num 0.0)) a)           // x + 0 → x
(rewrite (Mul a (Num 1.0)) a)           // x * 1 → x  
(rewrite (Ln (Exp x)) x)                // ln(exp(x)) → x
(rewrite (Pow a (Num 1.0)) a)           // x^1 → x

// STRICT LIMITS:
(run 3)  // Limited iterations prevent runaway optimization
```
