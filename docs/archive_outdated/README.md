# Archived Documentation

**Date Archived**: June 10, 2025
**Reason**: Documentation cleanup to reduce confusion and focus on current APIs

## What's Here

This directory contains documentation that was moved out of the main docs folder because it describes:

1. **Completed Work**: Migration guides for API transitions that are finished
2. **Theoretical Designs**: Academic/theoretical explorations that aren't current implementation
3. **Historical Artifacts**: Design documents for approaches that have been superseded

## Categories

### API Migration Documents (COMPLETED)
- `SUMMATION_*_GUIDE.md` - Summation API migrations (complete)
- `UNIFIED_*_PLAN.md` - API unification work (complete)
- `UNIFIED_*_PROPOSAL.md` - Proposals that were implemented

### Theoretical Documentation
- `VARIABLE_COMPOSITION_THEORY.md` - Academic exploration of variable composition
- `type_level_variable_scoping_design.md` - Type-level scoping design theory  
- `trait_based_compile_time_system.md` - Compile-time system theory

### Historical System Documentation
- `dslcompile_system_diagram.md` - Old architecture diagrams
- `COLLECTION_SUMMATION_DESIGN.md` - Design docs for implemented features

## Why Archived

These documents were creating confusion because:
- They described completed migrations as if they were still in progress
- They mixed theoretical exploration with practical usage guidance
- They referenced deprecated APIs that are no longer current
- They made it hard to find what actually works right now

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date information, see:
- `../CURRENT_STATE.md` - What works right now
- `../ROADMAP.md` - Current project status
- `../DEVELOPER_NOTES.md` - Architecture overview
- `../DSL_System_Architecture.md` - Complete system documentation
- `../dslcompile/examples/` - Working code examples
