# Archived HList Support

## Overview
This directory contains the HList integration support that was removed in PR [date]. The 889-line `hlist_support.rs` file provided zero-cost heterogeneous operations using frunk HLists.

## Why Archived
According to memories, frunk HLists are confirmed as part of the DSLCompile system, but this implementation was removed during a simplification effort. The file is preserved here for reference and potential restoration.

## Key Components (889 lines)
- `IntoVarHList`: Convert values into typed variable expressions
- `IntoConcreteSignature`: Generate function signatures from HList types  
- `HListEval`: Zero-cost evaluation with HList storage
- `FunctionSignature`: Code generation support

## Technical Features
- Zero-cost heterogeneous operations
- Type-safe compile-time optimized parameter passing
- No runtime type erasure or Vec flattening
- Support for mixed scalar and data array parameters
- Lambda evaluation with variable substitution

## Status
This was substantial infrastructure (889 lines) that may need to be restored based on the architectural needs. The user confirmed that frunk HLists should be part of the system.

## Recovery
To restore this functionality, the file can be copied back to:
`dslcompile/src/contexts/dynamic/expression_builder/hlist_support.rs`
