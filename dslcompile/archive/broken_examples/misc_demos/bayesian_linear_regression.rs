//! Advanced Bayesian Linear Regression with Type-Level Variable Scoping
//!
//! This example demonstrates the power of Rust's type system for mathematical
//! modeling by implementing Bayesian linear regression with:
//! - Type-level variable scoping for zero collision risk
//! - Compile-time mathematical optimization  
//! - Advanced statistical computation capabilities
//! - Perfect composability for complex models
